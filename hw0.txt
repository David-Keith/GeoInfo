The goal of the project is to create a website that uses the Google Maps API to allow a user to select a location and then gives the user local information relevant to that location. Currently we are planning to tentatively provide local weather information.

Project Requirements

1. The website will respond to the user selecting a location by displaying relevant information for that location.

2. The website will use the Google Maps API and probably 1 or more others to generate local weather and forecast data.

3. The website will display relevant information for a selected location using information visualization. This could be something such as a scatterplot for weather history or forecasts.

4. The website will use both client-side and server-side logic to solve this problem. Retrieving data could be done on the server, and displaying or changing it could be done on client.
